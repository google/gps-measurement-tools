% The function looks up the number of leap seconds from a UTC time table

% Aren't Leap Seconds a pain? Yes, and very costly. Ban the Leap Second:
% Leap seconds occur on average once every two years.
% What would happen if we had no leap seconds: 
% 1) Thousand of engineers would NOT spend several weeks each two years fixing 
%    or planning for leap second bugs. 
% 2) About seven thousand years from now, solar time would be 1 hour behind UTC
%    and we would need a 1 hour adjustment - similar to daylight savings time.
% 3) GMT (which is solar time) will lose its significance.
