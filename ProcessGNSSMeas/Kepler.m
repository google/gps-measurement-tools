function ek = Kepler(mk,e)

% ek = Kepler(mk,e) 
%    Kepler - Solves Kepler's equation for ek through iteration.

% Inputs:  mk: mean anomaly (rad)
%           e:  eccentricity
% Outputs: ek: eccentric anomaly
%
% NOTE: mk and e may be a vectors of the same dimensions, or one may be a scalar
%       the output is a vector of the same dimensions as the input vector
